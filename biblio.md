The Monsters in Your Build Cache – GitHub Actions Cache Poisoning,https://adnanthekhan.com/2024/05/06/the-monsters-in-your-build-cache-github-actions-cache-poisoning/,"The post provides an in-depth analysis of cache poisoning in CI/CD environments, including theoretical background and practical proof-of-concept attacks. It explains how attackers can exploit GitHub Actions caching, highlights real-world impacts on repositories like Angular and Mozilla MDN, and introduces the novel concept of Actions Cache Blasting.","The article thoroughly explains the attack but lacks detailed discussion on mitigation strategies. It could be improved by suggesting stricter cache validation, exploring ways GitHub could enhance security, and providing tools for maintainers to detect cache poisoning risks.","This blog post by Adnan Khan explores a security issue in GitHub Actions caching, where attackers can manipulate cache storage to replace legitimate cache entries, leading to privilege escalation and potential compromise of sensitive data.",Cacheract
How to secure your GitHub Actions workflows with CodeQL,https://github.blog/security/application-security/how-to-secure-your-github-actions-workflows-with-codeql/#results,"The article highlights how GitHub Actions workflows are now analyzed as a structured language in CodeQL, enabling deeper security scanning. It explains how taint tracking follows the flow of untrusted data, how Bash script analysis detects shell command vulnerabilities, and how new queries help prevent cache poisoning attacks. The approach has been successfully applied to over 75 open-source projects, detecting 90+ security issues.","While CodeQL’s security enhancements are valuable, improvements could include expanding taint tracking for complex workflows involving multiple repositories, providing automated remediation suggestions, and improving detection of logic-based attacks such as TOCTOU vulnerabilities.","This article from GitHub’s security blog discusses how CodeQL has been enhanced to detect vulnerabilities in GitHub Actions workflows, focusing on workflow misconfigurations, untrusted data sources, and the use of taint tracking to improve security analysis.",CodeQL
GitHub’s Native Attestation Support (https://github.com/INRIA/spoon/attestations),https://github.com/INRIA/spoon/attestations,"GitHub provides a web UI (""Attestations"" tab) and CLI command (gh attestation verify) for verifying artifact provenance. This helps prevent supply chain attacks.",It is unclear how many repositories use attestations and whether GitHub provides a public transparency log for attestations.,Ensuring that software artifacts in GitHub Actions are verifiable and haven’t been tampered with.,
GitHub Attestation API (https://docs.github.com/en/rest/users/attestations),https://docs.github.com/en/rest/users/attestations?apiVersion=2022-11-28,"The API allows for automated verification of software artifacts, ensuring that only trusted artifacts are used in production.",Fine-grained adoption statistics would help measure the real-world impact of this security feature.,Enables developers to programmatically retrieve and verify artifact attestations.,
I'll think twice before using Github Actions again,https://ninkovic.dev/blog/2025/think-twice-before-using-github-actions,"GitHub Actions struggles with monorepos because required checks depend on specific workflow names rather than dynamically adjusting based on triggered jobs. YAML-based workflows require excessive conditional logic, making maintenance difficult. The inability to test workflows locally leads to inefficient debugging. Additionally, GitHub’s lack of response to usability concerns has led some users to consider alternatives like GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, TeamCity, and Dagger, which offer better workflow flexibility.","GitHub Actions should allow required checks to dynamically adjust based on executed jobs, improve YAML syntax to reduce redundant logic, enable local workflow execution for easier debugging, and improve communication regarding its roadmap and feature development.","This blog post highlights several usability and scalability issues in GitHub Actions, particularly for teams managing monorepos. Key concerns include the inefficiency of required checks, the complexity of YAML for workflow management, the lack of local testing support, and GitHub’s slow response to addressing long-standing usability issues. The author suggests that these limitations make alternative CI/CD solutions more viable.","None directly mentioned, but alternative CI/CD solutions discussed include GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, TeamCity, and Dagger."blio.md…]()
