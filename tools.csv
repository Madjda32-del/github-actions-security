Cacheract,https://github.com/adnanekhan/cacheract?tab=readme-ov-file#top,https://adnanthekhan.com/2024/05/06/the-monsters-in-your-build-cache-github-actions-cache-poisoning/,"The primary focus of the tool and the research is to demonstrate weaknesses in GitHub Actions caching. Specifically, it highlights how attackers can manipulate cache storage to inject malicious files, which are then automatically restored in future workflow runs. This can lead to executing arbitrary code inside workflows, stealing GitHub secrets or access tokens, and compromising build artifacts as part of a larger supply chain attack. The attack exploits GitHub's cache eviction process and the way cache keys are generated, showing how an attacker can anticipate or forcefully replace cached data.","Input Data: Workflows that use GitHub Actions caching, untrusted pull request execution, and cache keys that can be predicted; Output Data: A poisoned cache that replaces files in future workflow runs, allowing attackers to overwrite critical files like package.json, leading to potential remote code execution."
CodeQL,https://github.com/github/codeql?tab=readme-ov-file#codeql,https://github.blog/security/application-security/how-to-secure-your-github-actions-workflows-with-codeql/#results,"The main goal of these new CodeQL capabilities is to identify and prevent vulnerabilities in GitHub Actions workflows by analyzing how untrusted data flows through workflows. Specifically, CodeQL can detect code injection risks, such as user-controlled input being used unsafely in a run command; track untrusted data sources, like workflow artifacts that could be manipulated by an attacker; and find workflow misconfigurations that might lead to privilege escalation or cache poisoning. This is especially important because many GitHub repositories unknowingly have insecure workflows that attackers could exploit.","Input Data: GitHub Actions workflow YAML files, Bash scripts, environment variables, GitHub event contexts (e.g., pull request metadata).Output Data: CodeQL generates alerts and reports that flag potential security issues, helping maintainers patch vulnerabilities before they are exploited."
Tmate,https://github.com/mxschmitt/action-tmate,,"action-tmate is a GitHub Action designed to help users debug their workflows by allowing direct SSH access to the runner. It enables developers to inspect, troubleshoot, and fix issues interactively within their GitHub Actions environments. The tool provides an on-demand tmate session that can be accessed via SSH or a web-based terminal, making it easier to diagnose CI/CD failures without multiple commit attempts.","Input Data: GitHub Actions workflows running on Linux, macOS, or Windows, workflow jobs requiring debugging, user-defined settings like detached mode, timeout, or access control; Output Data: An interactive tmate session link for SSH or web access, real-time terminal access to inspect the environment, the ability to pause a workflow, execute commands, and manually debug before resuming or terminating the job."
poutine,https://github.com/boostsecurityio/poutine,,"Poutine is a security scanner that detects misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in the build pipelines of a repository, supporting multiple CI/CD platforms including GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD.","Input Data: CI/CD workflow configurations, repositories from GitHub or GitLab, access tokens for security analysis. Output Data: Security reports highlighting misconfigurations, potential vulnerabilities, and policy violations."
